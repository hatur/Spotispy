# Spotispy

Spotispy is a Windows program that can lower the volume or mute the sound when an Ad is playing (using the Windows soundmixer). Additionally it has the funcitonality to output a .txt file that can be used with OBS or similar streaming programs to show the curerntly playing Song on stream or with OBS recorded videos. The program is currently only tested on Windows 10, but it should work on Windows 7 onwards.

If you want to recompile the program you need to download CPP Rest (Casablanca) and link the .lib file.
